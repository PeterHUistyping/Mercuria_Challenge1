# Mercuria Hackathon 2022
## Challenge
```
Challenge 1
Monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from large ships using EU ports.
Description
In 2013, the Commission set out a strategy towards reducing GHG emissions from the shipping industry. The strategy consists of 3 consecutive steps starting with monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from large ships using EU ports.
Teaser
• Wouldn’t it be helpful if we could better track and verify shipping journeys and categorise the worst polluters?
Why it matters
• Mercuria has subsidiaries that supply bunker fuel to the world’s shipping fleet as well as operating a fleet of ships.

Step 1: AIS monitoring
Using AIS data, track a vessel over a voyage and report on:
- Distance travelled
- Velocity
- Bunkers consumed
- GHG emissions
Step 2: Reporting
Each day, the vessel crew will provide a Noon Report to the Operator who is managing their voyage.
Create a process for vessel activity report data to be uploaded to your application.
Create a process for your application to automatically submit vessel activity reports.
Step 3: Verification
Compare manual reports with automated reports from Step 2.
Create a verification method for the data manually provided with the ability to highlight incorrect reporting.
Step 4: Analyse
For the data provided, across all time, rank the top 100 most polluting vessels along with the GHGs they emitted.
